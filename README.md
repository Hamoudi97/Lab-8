# Student Object and JavaScript Fundamentals

This project demonstrates the basic use of JavaScript objects, JSON manipulation, destructuring, the spread operator, and object methods.

## Project Overview

This project is split into 5 parts, each focusing on a different concept of JavaScript Object Manipulation:

1. **Understanding and Creating Objects**  
   - Creation of a `student` object with properties like `name`, `age`, `enrolled`, and `courses`.
   - A method to display basic student information.

2. **Working with JSON**  
   - Converting the `student` object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`.
   - Conversion of the JSON string back into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`.

3. **Using Destructuring Assignment**  
   - Extracting the `name` and `courses` properties from the `student` object using destructuring.
   - Destructuring an array of scores to extract specific elements.

4. **The Spread Operator**  
   - Cloning the `student` object using the spread operator and adding a new property.
   - Merging two arrays using the spread operator.

5. **Object Methods**  
   - Adding methods to the `student` object to add new courses and calculate the total number of courses.

6. **Bonus Task**  
   - Using the `reduce()` method to calculate the average score from an array of scores.
